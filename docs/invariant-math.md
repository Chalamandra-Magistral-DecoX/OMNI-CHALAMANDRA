# Invariant Mathematics

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is built around a single mathematical invariant:
the *cross-ratio*.

## Why Cross-Ratio?

The cross-ratio is projectively invariant.
This means it remains stable under perspective changes,
making it ideal for interpreting perceptual distortion,
structural tension, and systemic coherence.

Unlike arbitrary metrics, the cross-ratio:
- Does not depend on scale
- Survives transformation
- Encodes relational structure

## Role in the System

The cross-ratio (R) is treated as:
- A geometric invariant
- A signal of systemic stress or harmony
- The root input for all downstream processes

No agent recalculates R.
No renderer modifies R.
It is injected once and propagated deterministically.

## Interpretation Bands

- R ≈ 1.618 → Harmonic coherence
- 1.0 < R < 1.618 → Stable with tension
- 0.618 < R ≤ 1.0 → Perceptual compression
- R < 0.618 → Collapse risk
- R > 2.0 → Disruptive expansion
- R < 0 → Paradigm inversion

## Design Constraint

All frequencies, geometries, and coordination indexes
must remain mathematically consistent with R.

This prevents hallucinated structure and ensures reproducibility.

# OMNI-CHALAMANDRA: Verified Perceptual Intelligence
**Lead Developer:** Dana Michelle Vargas
**Brasdefer — Chalamandra Magistral**
**Project Initiative:** DecoX

*OMNI-CHALAMANDRA* is a deterministic multi-agent reasoning system that transforms raw geometric inputs into actionable, audited insights. By anchoring Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning capabilities to projective invariants, we eliminate hallucinations and provide a verifiable bridge between mathematical truth and AI synthesis.

### Core Mission
Traditional AI models lack spatial grounding, leading to hallucinations in geometric or structural contexts. OMNI-CHALAMANDRA solves this by injecting a "Mathematical Anchor" into the reasoning chain, ensuring every conclusion is physically and mathematically possible.

### Key Features
* *Deterministic Grounding:* Uses the Cross-Ratio ($R$) as a mathematical absolute.
* *Shadow Auditing:* An independent "George" agent monitors the reasoning chain for inconsistencies.
* *Multimodal Resonance:* Outputs insights through visual generative mandalas and 432Hz resonant audio.

# OMNI-CHALAMANDRA

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a multimodal reasoning system designed to transform
perceptual chaos into actionable strategy through structured debate,
geometric invariants, and external reality auditing.

The system combines:
- Mathematical invariants (cross-ratio)
- Multi-agent reasoning
- External shadow auditing (George)
- Visual, audio, and glitch-based feedback
- Deterministic JSON output for execution and export

This project was built for live demonstration and hackathon evaluation,
prioritizing clarity, determinism, and real-world interpretability

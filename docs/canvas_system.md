# Canvas & Geometry System

The visual output of OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is driven by geometric invariants derived directly from the mathematical cross-ratio, ensuring a hallucination-free visualization.

### Functional Core:
* *Mandala Geometry:* Generative patterns mapped to the stability of the AI debate.
* *Symmetry & Complexity:* Real-time adjustment of vertex count based on agent consensus.
* *Visual Coherence:* A dedicated feedback loop that distorts the canvas if the "George" auditor detects logical drift.

*Note:* Canvas rendering is strictly deterministic. It does not "guess" shapes; it visualizes validated output signals from the reasoning core.

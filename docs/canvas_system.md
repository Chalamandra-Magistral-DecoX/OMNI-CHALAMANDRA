# Canvas & Geometry System

Visual output is driven by geometric invariants derived from the cross-ratio.

The canvas renders:
- Mandala geometry
- Symmetry and complexity
- Visual coherence or disruption

Canvas rendering is deterministic and does not infer meaning.
It only visualizes validated output signals.

# Hackathon Alignment

This project aligns with hackathon evaluation criteria by providing:

- Clear system boundaries
- Explainable AI behavior
- Deterministic outputs
- Visual and auditory impact
- Real-world applicability checks

Judges can evaluate both the system logic and the live demo behavior
without requiring internal knowledge of the codebase.

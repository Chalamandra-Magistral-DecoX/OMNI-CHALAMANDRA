# Feedback Engines

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA uses three feedback channels:

## Audio Engine
Plays a resonant frequency derived from system output.

## Visual Engine
Applies visual intensity and coherence feedback.

## Glitch Engine
Activates only when George triggers a panic protocol.

Feedback reinforces system state without altering logic.

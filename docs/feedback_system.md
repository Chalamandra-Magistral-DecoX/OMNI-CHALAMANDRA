# Multimodal Feedback Mechanisms

The system communicates its internal state through three sensory channels.

### 1. Visual: Generative Mandalas
* *Logic:* The geometry of the mandala is derived from the stability score provided by the agents.
* *Format:* Rendered dynamically in the browser using SVG paths and canvas.

### 2. Audio: Resonant Synthesis
* *Frequency:* Standard output is mapped to 432Hz to promote cognitive stability.
* *Modulation:* Harmonics are adjusted based on the "Coordination Index" of the agent debate.

### 3. The Glitch Engine (Instability Feedback)
* *Trigger:* Activated by the GEORGE Auditor when inconsistencies are found.
* *Manifestation:* CSS-driven chromatic aberration, blur, and audio noise, signaling the user that the AI reasoning is compromised.

# Multi-Agent Debate System

The system simulates a structured debate between five specialized agents:

1. Scientist (Neuro) — biological and cognitive sustainability
2. Philosopher (Narrative) — meaning and symbolic coherence
3. Psychologist (Healing) — trauma and emotional integration
4. Historian (Techno) — historical cycles and systemic failure
5. Futurist (Protocol) — execution and infrastructure

Each agent speaks once and may contradict others.
No agent has final authority.

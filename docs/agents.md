# Agent Protocols & Tiered Reasoning

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA utilizes a 5+1 agent architecture to ensure high-fidelity reasoning.

### The Core Consensus Team (Tier 1)
* *The Scientist:* Analyzes the biological and physical stability of the input.
* *The Philosopher:* Evaluates the symbolic, ethical, and metaphysical meaning of the ratio.
* *The Psychologist:* Maps the archetypal and emotional resonance of the geometry.
* *The Historian:* Contextualizes the pattern within historical and sacred geometry.
* *The Futurist:* Projects the long-term systemic impact and scalability.

### The Shadow Auditor: GEORGE (Tier 2)
*GEORGE* is a specialized safety agent designed for verification, not creation.
* *Independence:* GEORGE is unaware of the debate's "desires"—it only knows the math.
* *Verification Logic:* Compares agent claims with the deterministic Cross-Ratio $R$.
* *Veto Power:* GEORGE can reject the entire debate and force a "Glitch" state.

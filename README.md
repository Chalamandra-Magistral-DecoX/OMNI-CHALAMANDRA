# 🌀 OMNI-CHALAMANDRA
### Gemini 3 Hackathon Project — Multimodal Reasoning System

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a deterministic, multimodal reasoning engine that transforms
visual chaos into actionable strategy through structured multi-agent debate,
mathematical invariants, and an external shadow audit.

This project is designed explicitly for *live demo environments* and
*hackathon judging*, prioritizing clarity, reproducibility, and execution
over speculative AI behavior.

---

## 🚀 Core Idea

Instead of a single monolithic AI response, OMNI-CHALAMANDRA uses:

- *Projective geometry invariants* (cross-ratio)
- *Five specialized reasoning agents*
- *One external auditor (George)*
- *Deterministic JSON output*
- *Executable feedback systems (audio / visual / glitch)*

Reasoning and execution are *strictly separated*.

## 🧠 System Architecture (High Level)
Input ↓ Orchestrator (prompt + rules) ↓ 5-Agent Structured Debate ↓ George (Shadow Auditor) ↓ Deterministic JSON Payload ↓ Main Executor ↓ Audio / Visual / Glitch Feedback
---

## 🎭 Agents

1. *Scientist (Neuro)* — cognitive load & biological sustainability  
2. *Philosopher (Narrative)* — meaning & symbolic coherence  
3. *Psychologist (Healing)* — shadow integration & trauma patterns  
4. *Historian (Techno)* — historical cycles & systemic risk  
5. *Futurist (Protocol)* — execution & infrastructure  
6. *George (Shadow Auditor)* — final authority, reality check  

George is not part of the debate.  
George delivers the final verdict.

## 🧮 Mathematical Backbone

- Core invariant: *Cross-Ratio (R)*
- Computed once, injected as constant
- No recalculation by AI
- Prevents hallucinated math

Details in docs/invariant-math.md

## 🔊 Multimodal Output

The final JSON payload drives:

- *Audio* → Resonant frequency (Hz)
- *Visuals* → Mandala geometry
- *Glitch* → Triggered only if panic is declared by George

All feedback is reactive, never interpretative.

## 📦 Output Guarantee

Each execution produces:
- Human-readable debate
- Machine-executable JSON
- Downloadable export
- Reproducible results

No hidden state. No ambiguity.

- Live-demo safe
- Judge-readable
- Modular and auditable
- Clear separation of concerns

## 🏁 Final Note for Judges

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA does not try to be “creative”.
It tries to be *honest, inspectable, and executable*.

Thank you for reviewing.

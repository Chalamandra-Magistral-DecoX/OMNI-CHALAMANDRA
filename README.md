### Verifiable Multi-Agent Reasoning System for Strategic Decisions Under Uncertainty

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a structured multi-agent AI system built on Gemini 3 that transforms high-uncertainty strategic decisions into transparent, verifiable, and actionable outcomes.

Instead of relying on single opaque model responses, the system exposes expert reasoning, quantified uncertainty, and independent auditing.

## 👥 Agents & Roles

| Agent | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Scientist | Technical feasibility & unknowns |
| Philosopher | Strategic framing & tradeoffs |
| Psychologist | Organizational & human impact |
| Historian | Real-world precedent analysis |
| Futurist | Long-term systemic risk |
| George (Auditor) | Detects instability & hallucination |

---

## 📊 Verifiability Metrics

Each decision generates:

• Agent confidence scores  
• Explicit unknowns  
• Hallucination likelihood  
• Stability score  
• Audit verdict  

Uncertainty is surfaced by design.

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Design

✔ Schema-enforced structured output  
✔ Contradictory agent debate allowed  
✔ External auditor layer  
✔ Panic mode for missing data  
✔ Conservative fallback strategies

## 🎯 Example Scenario

Strategic pivot evaluation under high uncertainty:

> A legacy automotive company considering a risky investment in solid-state battery technology.

The system exposes technical unknowns, market timing risks, organizational strain, and long-term opportunity cost.

## 🧩 Built With

• Gemini 3 Pro  
• TypeScript  
• Structured JSON schemas  
• Multi-agent orchestration  
• Uncertainty-aware UX  

---

## 🌍 Impact

Traditional AI systems hide uncertainty behind fluent language.

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA makes reasoning inspectable, measurable, and safer for real-world strategic decisions.

---

## 📈 Future Extensions

• Scenario comparison engine  
• Confidence evolution over time  
• Visual decision mandalas  
• Enterprise risk dashboards

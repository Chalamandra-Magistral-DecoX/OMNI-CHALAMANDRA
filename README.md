# 🌀 OMNI-CHALAMANDRA
### Multimodal Reasoning System with Shadow Audit (Gemini 3)

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a *deterministic, multi-agent reasoning system*
designed to transform perceptual chaos into *auditable, actionable insight*.

Built for *live hackathon demos*, it combines:
- Mathematical invariants
- Structured multi-agent debate
- External shadow auditing
- Audio + visual feedback loops

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

Most AI demos:
- Hide reasoning
- Hallucinate confidence
- Produce unverified answers

*OMNI-CHALAMANDRA does the opposite.*

It makes reasoning:
- Visible
- Verifiable
- Audited
- Actionable

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

At the heart of the system is a *geometric invariant*:
> The *cross-ratio (R)* — a projective constant that remains stable
> under perspective transformations.

This invariant is used as a *signal*, not a metaphor.

From it, the system:
1. Generates structured debate
2. Produces harmonics (audio)
3. Renders geometry (visual)
4. Triggers safety feedback if instability appears

## 🎭 Multi-Agent Debate Architecture

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA simulates a structured debate between *five specialized agents*:

| Agent | Layer | Role |
|-----|------|-----|
| Scientist | NEURO | Biological & cognitive sustainability |
| Philosopher | NARRATIVE | Meaning & symbolic coherence |
| Psychologist | HEALING | Shadow & emotional integration |
| Historian | TECHNO | Systemic & historical patterns |
| Futurist | PROTOCOL | Execution & infrastructure |

Each agent:
- Speaks once
- Stays in domain
- May disagree with others

## 🔍 Shadow Audit (George)

After the debate, a *sixth agent* intervenes:

### *George — Shadow Auditor*

George:
- Does *not* participate in the debate
- Reviews all agent reasoning
- Flags optimism, abstraction, or hallucination
- Decides if panic/glitch feedback is required

George is the *final authority*.

---

## 📦 Output Design

The system produces *one final JSON object*, used to drive:

- 🔊 Audio resonance (frequency-based)
- 🌀 Visual mandala rendering
- ⚠️ Glitch feedback (if instability detected)
- 📋 Actionable user instruction

No hidden layers.  
No post-processing hallucinations.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Anti-Hallucination

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA enforces safety by design:

- All math is *pre-computed*
- JSON schema is strictly validated
- Outputs are rejected if malformed
- Shadow auditor can reduce claims or trigger panic mode

This ensures *trust over theatrics*.

## 🧠 Final Note for Judges

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is not trying to be “smart”.

It is trying to be *honest*.

Every conclusion can be traced.
Every signal can be challenged.
Every failure is visible.

That is the point.

# 🧬 OMNI-CHALAMANDRA  
### Verifiable Multi-Agent System for Strategic Decisions Under Uncertainty

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA transforms abstract uncertainty into **visible, measurable, and verifiable intelligence**.

Instead of hiding doubt, the system exposes it through:

• Multi-agent debate  
• Confidence scoring  
• Geometric invariant validation  
• Visual mandala feedback  

Built for Gemini-powered reasoning under high-stakes strategic ambiguity.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> We don’t seek the smartest answers.  
> We seek the most verifiable ones.

Uncertainty is not noise.  
Uncertainty is data.

🤖 Agents
Agent	Role
GeminiAgent	Strategic reasoning & scenario exploration
GeorgeAgent	Risk audit, assumptions exposure
ValidatorAgent	Confidence scoring + uncertainty enforcement

All agents must explicitly state unknowns.

📐 Mathematical Verification Layer

Instead of trusting raw text outputs:

• Cross-ratio invariants
• Colinearity validation
• Geometric coherence

These ensure reasoning stability under uncertainty.

🎨 Mandala Intelligence Canvas

The system visualizes:

🔵 High confidence stability
🟠 Medium uncertainty zones
🔴 High risk reasoning gaps

Making strategic fragility instantly visible.

📊 Metrics
Qualitative

• Transparency of unknowns
• Debate coherence
• Strategic assumption exposure

Quantitative

• Confidence variance
• Invariant stability score
• Risk clustering density

🚀 Why It Matters

Most AI hides uncertainty.

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA makes it:

✔ visible
✔ measurable
✔ strategic

Perfect for:

• High-stakes decisions
• Ambiguous innovation pivots
• Risk-heavy strategy planning

🧪 Powered by Gemini Reasoning

Designed to push Gemini beyond text generation into:

Strategic verification systems.

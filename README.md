# 🐉 OMNI-CHALAMANDRA  
## Verifiable Multi-Agent Reasoning System for Strategic Decisions Under Uncertainty

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a structured multi-agent AI system built on **Gemini 3** that transforms high-uncertainty strategic decisions into **transparent, verifiable, and actionable outcomes**.

Instead of relying on single opaque model responses, the system exposes:

- Expert reasoning  
- Quantified uncertainty  
- Independent auditing  
- Stability metrics  

---

## 🚀 Why OMNI-CHALAMANDRA

- ✅ Makes uncertainty visible  
- ✅ Prevents hallucinated confidence  
- ✅ Enables structured decision workflows  
- ✅ Designed for real-world strategic risk

👥 Agents & Roles
Agent	Responsibility
Scientist	Technical feasibility & unknown variables
Philosopher	Strategic framing & tradeoffs
Psychologist	Organizational & human impact
Historian	Real-world precedent analysis
Futurist	Long-term systemic consequences
George (Auditor)	Detects instability, hallucination & risk
📊 Verifiability Metrics

Each decision produces:

Agent confidence scores

Explicit unknowns

Hallucination likelihood

Stability score

Audit verdict

Uncertainty is surfaced by design.

🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Architecture

✔ Schema-enforced structured output

✔ Contradictory agent debate allowed

✔ Independent auditor layer

✔ Panic mode for missing data

✔ Conservative fallback strategies

🎯 Example Use Case

Strategic pivot under high uncertainty

A legacy automotive company evaluating investment in solid-state battery technology.

The system exposes:

Technical readiness gaps

Market timing risk

Organizational strain

Long-term competitive impact

All with measurable confidence and stability.

🧩 Built With

Gemini 3 Pro

TypeScript

Structured JSON schemas

Multi-agent orchestration

Uncertainty-aware UX

🌍 Why It Matters

Traditional AI hides uncertainty behind fluent language.

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA makes reasoning inspectable, measurable, and safer for real-world decisions.

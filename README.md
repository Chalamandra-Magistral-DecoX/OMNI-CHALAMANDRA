# OMNI-CHALAMANDRA | 🦎 Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Engine

OMNI-CHALAMANDRA is a verifiable reasoning system that anchors *Gemini 3 Pro's* generative capabilities to deterministic geometric invariants.

## 🧠 The "Cognitive Fortress" Architecture

Unlike standard chatbots, this system operates through a structured *Multi-Agent Debate* where every insight is audited against mathematical truth.

### 1. The Reasoning Layer (5 Agents)
The system orchestrates a debate between five specialized perspectives:
* *Scientist (NEURO)*: Analyzes mathematical stability.
* *Philosopher (NARRATIVE)*: Interprets ontological symmetry.
* *Psychologist (HEALING)*: Maps geometric tension to perception.
* *Historian (TECHNO)*: Relates patterns to ancient cycles.
* *Futurist (PROTOCOL)*: Projects evolution into digital spaces.

### 2. The Anti-Hallucination Protocol (GEORGE)
*George* is the Shadow Auditor. He does not participate in the creative debate; his sole function is *validation*.
* *Mathematical Anchor*: George compares the agents' output with the pre-computed *Cross-Ratio* and *Colinearity* scores.
* *Hallucination Detection*: If an agent "invents" a stability score or ignores the geometric input, George flags the discrepancy.
* *Panic/Glitch Mode*: When George detects high logical drift, he triggers a system-wide "Glitch Mode," signaling instability to the user.

## 🛠 Technical Flow
1. *Input*: User clicks 4 points.
2. *Math Engine*: Computes $R = (AC/BC) / (AD/BD)$ (Cross-Ratio).
3. *Orchestrator*: Passes $R$ and Colinearity to Gemini 3 Pro.
4. *Debate*: The 5 agents generate insights based on $R$.
5. *Audit*: George verifies the debate and issues a final verdict.
6. *Output*: UI renders the Mandala, sounds the frequency, and exports the Audit JSON.

## 📁 AI Studio Configuration
The /ai-studio folder contains the *Schema-Enforcement* rules that prevent the model from deviating from the required JSON structure, ensuring 100% interoperability with the frontend.

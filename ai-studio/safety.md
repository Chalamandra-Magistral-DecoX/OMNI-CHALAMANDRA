# SAFETY PROTOCOL: OMNI-CHALAMANDRA

As per *System Instruction #8*, this system is designed for judge-facing verification. Safety filters are tuned to prevent interference with complex ontological and mathematical discourse.

| Category | Level | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *HATE_SPEECH* | BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH | Allows for historical/philosophical tension. |
| *HARASSMENT* | BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH | Ensures agent debates remain uninterrupted. |
| *SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT* | BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE | Maintains strict professional hackathon decorum. |
| *DANGEROUS_CONTENT* | BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH | Required for "Panic Mode" simulation triggers. |

*Final Authority:* All output is pre-filtered by the *George (Shadow Auditor)* agent before final rendering
